/* Problem:
 * A warehouse stores a list of equipments.
 * When first created, a warehouse is set with a capacity 
 * (i.e., maximum number of equipments with distinct names). 
 * 
 * Each equipment is characterized by its name (e.g., "WD Hard Disk Drive", "iPad Pro") 
 * 	and its quantity in the warehouse (e.g., 4).
 *  
 * Given an equipment, we may add or remove its stock (by increasing or decreasing its quantity), 
 * 	as well as access its product name, quantity, or status. 
 * 
 * An equipment's status should be a summary of its name and current quantity in the warehouse. 
 * 	However, if the last invoked mutator resulted in an error (e.g., due to insufficient stock), then
 * 	the equipment's status should be the corresponding error message.
 * 
 * Given a warehouse, we may, e.g.:
 * 	- Add an input equipment. Here are the cases to consider:
 * 		+ If the warehouse's capacity is reached, then do nothing. 
 * 		+ If the input equipment already exists (by its name) in the warehouse, then update its stock accordingly.
 *     	+ If the input equipment does not exist, then add it to the end of the warehouse's stored list.
 * 
 * For other functionalities, details, and examples, see below for the test methods and in-line comments.

	 * Programming Requirements:
	 * 	- You are only allowed to use primitive arrays (e.g., int[], String[], Facility[]) 
	 * 		for declaring attributes and implementing methods.
	 * 	- Any use of a Java library class or method is forbidden 
	 * 		(that is, use selections and loops to build your solution from scratch instead):
	 * 	- Here are some examples of forbidden classes/methods: 
	 * 		- Arrays class (e.g., Arrays.copyOf)
	 * 		- System class (e.g., System.arrayCopy)
	 * 		- ArrayList class
	 * 		- String class (e.g., substring).
	 * 	- The use of some library classes does not require an import statement, 
	 * 		but these classes are also forbidden to be used.
	 * 	- Here are the exceptions (library methods which you are allowed to use if needed):
	 * 		- String class (equals, format)
	 * 
	 * You will receive an immediate zero if this requirement is violated.

	/*
	 * Your expected workflow should be:
	 * Step 1: Eliminate compilation errors. 
	 * 	Declare all the required classes and methods (returning default values if necessary), 
	 * 	so that the project contains no compilation errors (i.e., no red crosses shown on the Eclipse editor).
	 * Step 2: Pass all unit tests. Add private attributes and complete the method implementations accordingly, 
	 * 	so that executing all tests result in a green bar.
	 * 
	 * If necessary, you are free to declare (private or public) helper methods.
